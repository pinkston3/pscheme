# Scheme24

I wrote a very basic Scheme interpreter for use in CS24, "Introduction to
Computing Systems."  The interpreter had two main points:

*   Give CS students an example of how a Scheme interpreter can be
    implemented, simply by following the environment model as described in
    [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs-second-edition).
    (At the time, our introductory computer-science class CS1 used both Scheme
    and SICP.)

*   Give CS students an opportunity to implement a basic mark-and-sweep
    garbage collector.

Of course, I also wanted to do it because it seemed fun to do, and it was fun.
The problem is:

*   CS1 is no longer taught in Scheme, so students don't know this crazy
    language with all the parentheses.

*   The work the students had to do in the Scheme24 interpreter wasn't
    particularly compelling, and was quite repetitive.  So, we came up with
    a much better garbage-collector assignment that's simpler, and tons of
    fun.

So, because there isn't really a point in keeping this project private,
here it is.  Enjoy.
